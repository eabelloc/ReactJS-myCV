          "Final Project for the Bootcamp of Full-Stack Web Development: During the last three weeks of my Bootcamp at NEOLAND (Madrid) from the 1st of September to the 22nd of September, I did my final project. In collaboration with my classmate Daniel, we developed both the back end and the front end of a social media app. For our database we used MongoDB and we used NodeJS to make a REST API with user authentication. For the Front End, we used ReactJS, and divided it in two perspectives, one from the user and one for the viewer. We had to composize even the smaller parts of the website, like buttons, inputs, searchbars, profile and project views, etc. Team work and stress management were crucial for the development of this app in such a short period. I learned a lot about time management, organization, problem solving, and conflict management during the making of this project, and gained a very good friend, which I continue to collaborate with even to this day. I also learned to use the Styled Components library, which was very useful in the making of many components. - 3 months experience as a developer.",
